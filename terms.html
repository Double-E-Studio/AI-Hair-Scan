            <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last updated: 20 February 2026</strong></p>

            <div class="policy-content">
                <p>These Terms and Conditions govern the use of the mobile application <strong>Hair Scan AI</strong> (the "Application"), developed by <strong>DoubleE Studio Team - Michele Cipriani and Tommaso Vilotto</strong> (the "Service Provider").</p>

                <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>By downloading, installing, or using the Application, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions in full. Access to core app functionality is subject to explicit in-app acceptance of these terms.</p>
                <p>If you do not accept these terms, you must not access or use the Application.</p>

                <h2>2. Nature of the Service</h2>
                <p>The Application provides a <strong>preliminary and indicative</strong> scalp analysis through photographic image processing and AI services (Google Gemini API).</p>
                <p>The Application is not intended for clinical practice, medical-device-regulated workflows, or professional medical decision-making.</p>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>IMPORTANT MEDICAL DISCLAIMER:</strong><br>
                    The Application does NOT provide medical diagnosis, clinical advice, or professional healthcare services. Scan results are purely <strong>informational and subjective</strong> and are not a substitute for medical consultation.<br><br>
                    For any scalp or hair health concern, you should consult a qualified dermatologist or trichologist.<br><br>
                    The Service Provider disclaims liability for user decisions made solely on the basis of app-generated results.
                </div>

                <h2>3. App Flow and Main Features</h2>
                <p>The Application includes the following flow and functionalities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial onboarding:</strong> optional contextual questions (age, sex, possible health concerns). This data is not stored in our database.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access options:</strong> continue with Google, continue with Apple ID, or continue without account.</li>
                    <li><strong>Terms acceptance:</strong> users must accept Terms before proceeding to scan features.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalp scan:</strong> the user captures 4 scalp photos and starts the scan process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ad-based unlock steps:</strong> some features (including scan unlock flows) may require viewing reward ads through Google AdMob.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI processing:</strong> photos are processed through Google Gemini API to generate a non-medical, indicative analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Home area:</strong> users can log hair-care products, review past scans (if account-based), and run new scans.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Age Requirement</h2>
                <p>Use of the Application is restricted to users who are at least <strong>18 years old</strong>. Users under 18 are not authorized to use this service.</p>

                    <li>Authenticate via <strong>Google</strong> or <strong>Apple ID</strong> for account-based features</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Photo Use and Processing</h2>

                <h2>7. Advertising and Credits</h2>
                <p>The Application uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display ads. Some features can be unlocked through reward ads. Ad viewing and ad data handling are subject to Google policies and, where required, user consent settings.</p>
