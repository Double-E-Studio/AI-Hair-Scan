                <ul>
                    <li>Are <strong>captured locally</strong> on the user's device</li>
                    <li>Are <strong>temporarily encoded and sent</strong> to Google Gemini API for analysis</li>

                    <li><strong>Record:</strong> we store a minimal consent log (timestamp, consent type, policy version, and user reference where available)</li>
                    <li><strong>Withdrawal:</strong> consent can be withdrawn at any time in app settings or by contacting us at <strong>doublee.studio.team@gmail.com</strong></li>

                <p>Camera images are used exclusively for the purpose of generating a scalp analysis via Google Gemini API. Photos are not permanently stored on Service Provider servers and are removed from temporary memory after analysis results are generated.</p>
                <p>Permission requests are handled in accordance with iOS and Android platform guidelines. Users may revoke permissions at any time through their device settings; however, revoking the camera permission will disable the scan functionality.</p>

                <h2>12. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
                <p>The Application does not directly use browser cookies, but integrated third-party services (such as AdMob or sign-in providers) may use similar tracking technologies for advertising, analytics, and service optimization.</p>

                <h2>13. Use Without Account</h2>
                <p>The Application can be used <strong>without creating an account</strong>. In this mode:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No account-linked personal identifier is stored by us</li>
                    <li>Scan history and results are stored locally on your device only</li>
                    <li>Scan history and results are not persisted to an account and are not synced across devices</li>
                    <li>Some features may be limited compared to account mode</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Photos are still processed through Google Gemini API as described above.</p>

                <h2>14. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
