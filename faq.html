                        Hair Scan AI is a mobile application that uses artificial intelligence (Google Gemini AI) to analyze your scalp health. By capturing 4 photos of your scalp, the app generates a detailed report covering hair density, Norwood scale evaluation, volume, and overall scalp condition.

                        After unlocking a scan, you capture <strong>4 photos</strong> of your scalp: front, right side, left side, and top. The app sends these images to Google Gemini AI, which analyzes them and returns a detailed text report. Photos are never saved on our servers — they are deleted from memory after analysis.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        There are two ways to unlock a scan:
                        <ul style="margin: 10px 0 0 1.2rem;">
                            <li><strong>From onboarding path:</strong> watch 3 short rewarded ads via Google AdMob.</li>
                            <li><strong>From the home area:</strong> spend 3 coins from your in-app coin balance.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Coins can be earned through the app's reward system.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        The onboarding asks optional questions about your age, sex, and any existing hair or health concerns. This information is used only to personalize your initial experience — it is <strong>not uploaded to any server</strong> and is stored locally on your device only.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Yes. Your scan history — including results and dates — is saved locally on your device and accessible from the home area of the app. All scan data remains on your device only, regardless of whether you're signed in or using the app as a guest.

                        Yes. An active internet connection is required to run a scan (photos are sent to Google Gemini AI), display ads, and sync your account data. Some browsing of the app is possible offline, but core scan functionality requires connectivity.

                        <strong>No.</strong> Hair Scan AI provides informational, AI-generated estimates only. The results are not a medical diagnosis and do not substitute a consultation with a qualified dermatologist or trichologist. Never make medical decisions based solely on the app's output.
